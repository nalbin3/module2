This project demonstrates symmetric and asymmetric encryption using Python.

1. Symmetric Encryption:
- Uses a single shared key (Fernet/AES)
- The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message.

2. Asymmetric Encryption:
- Uses a public/private key pair (RSA)
- Public key encrypts the message, private key decrypts it.

The file 'keys_and_output.txt' contains the keys used and the input/output results.
